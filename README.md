_Super Speedy Syslog Searcher_ (`s4`) is a command-line tool to search
and merge varying log messages from varying log files, sorted by datetime.
Datetime filters may be passed to narrow the search to a datetime range.

`s4` can read standardized log message formats like RFC 3164 and RFC 5424
("syslog"),
Red Hat Audit logs, strace output, and can read many non-standardized ad-hoc log
message formats, including multi-line log messages.
It also parses binary accounting records acct, lastlog, and utmp
(`acct`, `pacct`, `lastlog`, `utmp`, `utmpx`, `wtmp`),
systemd journal logs (`.journal`), and Microsoft Event Logs (`.evtx`).
`s4` can read logs that are compressed (`.bz2`, `.gz`, `.lz4`, `.xz`), or archived logs (`.tar`).

`s4` aims to be very fast.

## Use

### Install `super_speedy_syslog_searcher`

Assuming [rust is installed], run

```lang-text
cargo install --locked super_speedy_syslog_searcher
```

Some Linux platforms will require installing `make` to compile `jemalloc`.

Windows OS (`target_os="windows"`) with `target_env="msvc"` require `lib.exe`
to commpile `mimalloc`.

Check your rust compilation target settings with command `rustc --print cfg`.

[rust is installed]: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

### Run `s4`

For example, print all the log messages in syslog files under `/var/log/`

```lang-text
s4 /var/log
```

On Windows, print the ad-hoc logs under `C:\Windows\Logs`

```lang-text
s4.exe C:\Windows\Logs
```

On Windows, print all `.log` files under `C:\Windows` (with the help of Powershell)

```lang-powershell
Get-ChildItem -Filter '*.log' -File -Path "C:\Windows" -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue `
  | Select-Object -ExpandProperty FullName `
  | s4.exe -
```

<sup>(note that UTF-16 encoded logs cannot be parsed, see [Issue #16])</sup>

<sup>(note that opening too many files causes error _too many files open_, see [Issue #270], so `Get-ChildItem -Filter` lessens the number of files opened by `s4.exe`)</sup>

On Windows, print the [Windows Event logs]

```lang-text
s4.exe C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs
```

Print the log messages after January 1, 2022 at 00:00:00

```lang-text
s4 /var/log -a 20220101
```

Print the log messages from January 1, 2022 00:00:00 to January 2, 2022

```lang-text
s4 /var/log -a 20220101 -b 20220102
```

or

```lang-text
s4 /var/log -a 20220101 -b @+1d
```

Print the log messages on January 1, 2022, from 12:00:00 to 16:00:00

```lang-text
s4 /var/log -a 20220101T120000 -b 20220101T160000
```

Print the record-keeping log messages from up to a day ago
(with the help of `find`)

```lang-text
find /var -xdev -type f \( \
    -name 'lastlog' \
    -or -name 'wtmp' \
    -or -name 'wtmpx' \
    -or -name 'utmp' \
    -or -name 'utmpx' \
    -or -name 'acct' \
    -or -name 'pacct' \
  \) \
    2>/dev/null \
    | s4 - -a=-1d
```

Print the journal log messages from up to an hour ago,
prepending the journal file name
(with the help of `find`)

```lang-text
find / -xdev -name '*.journal' -type f 2>/dev/null \
    | s4 - -a=-1h -n
```

Print only the log messages that occurred two days ago
(with the help of GNU `date`)

```lang-text
s4 /var/log -a $(date -d "2 days ago" '+%Y%m%d') -b @+1d
```

Print only the log messages that occurred two days ago during the noon hour
(with the help of GNU `date`)

```lang-text
s4 /var/log -a $(date -d "2 days ago 12" '+%Y%m%dT%H%M%S') -b @+1h
```

Print only the log messages that occurred two days ago during the noon hour in
Bengaluru, India (timezone offset +05:30) and prepended with equivalent UTC
datetime (with the help of GNU `date`)

```lang-text
s4 /var/log -u -a $(date -d "2 days ago 12" '+%Y%m%dT%H%M%S+05:30') -b @+1h
```

### `--help`

```lang-text
Speedily search and merge log messages by datetime.
DateTime filters may be passed to narrow the search.
s4 aims to be very fast.

Usage: s4 [OPTIONS] <PATHS>...

Arguments:
  <PATHS>...  Path(s) of log files or directories.
              Directories will be recursed. Symlinks will be followed.
              Paths may also be passed via STDIN, one per line. The user must
              supply argument "-" to signify PATHS are available from STDIN.

Options:
  -a, --dt-after <DT_AFTER>
          DateTime Filter After: print log messages with a datetime that is at
          or after this datetime. For example, "20200102T120000" or "-5d".
  -b, --dt-before <DT_BEFORE>
          DateTime Filter Before: print log messages with a datetime that is at
          or before this datetime.
          For example, "2020-01-03T23:00:00.321-05:30" or "@+1d+11h"
  -t, --tz-offset <TZ_OFFSET>
          Default timezone offset for datetimes without a timezone.
          For example, log message "[20200102T120000] Starting service" has a
          datetime substring "20200102T120000".
          That datetime substring does not have a timezone offset
          so this TZ_OFFSET value would be used.
          Example values, "+12", "-0800", "+02:00", or "EDT".
          To pass a value with leading "-" use "=" notation, e.g. "-t=-0800".
          If not passed then the local system timezone offset is used.
          [default: -07:00]
  -z, --prepend-tz <PREPEND_TZ>
          Prepend a DateTime in the timezone PREPEND_TZ for every line.
          Used in PREPEND_DT_FORMAT.
  -u, --prepend-utc
          Prepend a DateTime in the UTC timezone offset for every line.
          This is the same as "--prepend-tz Z".
          Used in PREPEND_DT_FORMAT.
  -l, --prepend-local
          Prepend DateTime in the local system timezone offset for every line.
          This is the same as "--prepend-tz +XX" where +XX is the local system
          timezone offset.
          Used in PREPEND_DT_FORMAT.
  -d, --prepend-dt-format <PREPEND_DT_FORMAT>
          Prepend a DateTime using the strftime format string.
          If PREPEND_TZ is set then that value is used for any timezone offsets,
          i.e. strftime "%z" "%:z" "%Z" values, otherwise the timezone offset value
          is the local system timezone offset.
          [Default: %Y%m%dT%H%M%S%.3f%z]
  -n, --prepend-filename
          Prepend file basename to every line.
  -p, --prepend-filepath
          Prepend file full path to every line.
  -w, --prepend-file-align
          Align column widths of prepended data.
      --prepend-separator <PREPEND_SEPARATOR>
          Separator string for prepended data.
          [default: :]
      --separator <LOG_MESSAGE_SEPARATOR>
          An extra separator string between printed log messages.
          Per log message not per line of text.
          Accepts a basic set of backslash escape sequences,
          e.g. "\0" for the null character, "\t" for tab, etc.
      --journal-output <JOURNAL_OUTPUT>
          The format for .journal file log messages.
          Matches journalctl --output options.
          [default: short]
          [possible values: short, short-precise, short-iso, short-iso-precise,
          short-full, short-monotonic, short-unix, verbose, export, cat]
  -c, --color <COLOR_CHOICE>
          Choose to print to terminal using colors.
          [default: auto]
          [possible values: always, auto, never]
      --blocksz <BLOCKSZ>
          Read blocks of this size in bytes.
          May pass value as any radix (hexadecimal, decimal, octal, binary).
          Using the default value is recommended.
          Most useful for developers.
          [default: 65535]
  -s, --summary
          Print a summary of files processed to stderr.
          Most useful for developers.
  -h, --help
          Print help
  -V, --version
          Print version

Given a file path, the file format will be processed based on a best guess of
the file name.
If the file format is not guessed then it will be treated as a UTF8 text file.
Given a directory path, found file names that have well-known non-log file name
extensions will be skipped.

DateTime Filters may be strftime specifier patterns:
    "%Y%m%dT%H%M%S*"
    "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S*"
    "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S*"
    "%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S*"
    "%Y%m%d"
    "%Y-%m-%d"
    "%Y/%m/%d"
    "+%s"
Each * is an optional trailing 3-digit fractional sub-seconds,
or 6-digit fractional sub-seconds, and/or timezone.

Pattern "+%s" is Unix epoch timestamp in seconds with a preceding "+".
For example, value "+946684800" is be January 1, 2000 at 00:00, GMT.

DateTime Filters may be custom relative offset patterns:
    "+DwDdDhDmDs" or "-DwDdDhDmDs"
    "@+DwDdDhDmDs" or "@-DwDdDhDmDs"

Custom relative offset pattern "+DwDdDhDmDs" and "-DwDdDhDmDs" is the offset
from now (program start time) where "D" is a decimal number.
Each lowercase identifier is an offset duration:
"w" is weeks, "d" is days, "h" is hours, "m" is minutes, "s" is seconds.
For example, value "-1w22h" is one week and twenty-two hours in the past.
Value "+30s" is thirty seconds in the future.

Custom relative offset pattern "@+DwDdDhDmDs" and "@-DwDdDhDmDs" is relative
offset from the other datetime.
Arguments "-a 20220102 -b @+1d" are equivalent to "-a 20220102 -b 20220103".
Arguments "-a @-6h -b 20220101T120000" are equivalent to
"-a 20220101T060000 -b 20220101T120000".

Without a timezone, the Datetime Filter is presumed to be the local
system timezone.

Command-line passed timezones may be numeric timezone offsets,
e.g. "+09:00", "+0900", or "+09", or named timezone offsets, e.g. "JST".
Ambiguous named timezones will be rejected, e.g. "SST".

--prepend-tz and --dt-offset function independently:
--dt-offset is used to interpret processed log message datetime stamps that
do not have a timezone offset.
--prepend-tz affects what is pre-printed before each printed log message line.

--separator accepts backslash escape sequences:
    "\0", "\a", "\b", "\e", "\f", "\n", "\r", "\\", "\t", "\v"

Resolved values of "--dt-after" and "--dt-before" can be reviewed in
the "--summary" output.

s4 uses file naming to determine the file type.

s4 can process files compressed and named .bz2, .gz, .lz4, .xz, and files
archived within a .tar file.

DateTime strftime specifiers are described at
https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/

DateTimes supported are only of the Gregorian calendar.

DateTimes supported language is English.

## About

### Why `s4`?

_Super Speedy Syslog Searcher_ (`s4`) is meant to aid Engineers in reviewing
varying log files in a datetime-sorted manner.
The primary use-case is to aid investigating problems wherein the time of
a problem occurrence is known and there are many available logs
but otherwise there is little source evidence.

Currently, log file formats vary widely. _Most_ logs are an ad-hoc format.
Even separate log files on the same system for the same service may have
different message formats!
Sorting these logged messages by datetime may be prohibitively difficult.
The result is an engineer may have to "hunt and peck" among many log files,
looking for problem clues around some datetime; so tedious!

Enter _Super Speedy Syslog Searcher_ 🦸 ‼

`s4` will print log messages from multiple log files in datetime-sorted order.
A "window" of datetimes may be passed, to constrain the period of printed
messages. This will assist an engineer that, for example, needs to view all
log messages that occurred two days ago between 12:00 and 12:05 among log files taken from multiple
systems.

The ulterior motive for _Super Speedy Syslog Searcher_ was the [primary
developer](https://github.com/jtmoon79) wanted an excuse to learn rust 🦀,
and wanted to create an open-source tool for a recurring need of some
Software Test Engineers 😄

See the real-world example rationale in the section below,
[_logging chaos: the problem `s4` solves_].

#### File name guessing

Given a file path, `s4` will attempt to parse it. The type of file must be in
the name. Guesses are made about files with non-standard names.

For example, standard file name `utmp` will always be treated as a `utmp` record
file. But non-standard name `log.utmp.1` is guessed to be a `utmp` record file.
Similar guesses are applied to `lastlog`, `wtmp`, `acct`, `pacct`,
`journal`, and `evtx` files.
When combined with compression or archive file name extensions,
e.g. `.bz2`, `.gz`, `.lz4`, or `.xz`, then `s4` makes a best attempt at
guessing the compression or archive type and the file within the archive based
on the name.
For example, `user.journal.gz` is guessed to be a systemd journal file within a
gzip compressed file. However, if that same file is named something unusual like
`user.systemd-journal.gz` then it is guessed to be a text log file within a gzip
compressed file.

When a file type cannot be guessed then it is treated as a UTF8 text log file.
For example, a file name just `unknown` is not any obvious type so it is attempted
to be parsed as a UTF8 ad-hoc text log file.

`tar` files are inspected for parseable files.<sup><a href="#f2">\[2\]</a></sup>

#### Directory walks

Given a directory path, `s4` will walk the directory and all subdirectories and
follow symbolic links and cross file system paths.
`s4` will ignore files with extensions that are known to be non-log files.
For example, files with extensions `.dll`, `.mp3`, `.png`, or `.so`, are
unlikely to be log files and so are not processed.

So given a file `/tmp/file.mp3`, an  invocation of `s4 /tmp` will not attempt
to process `file.mp3`. An invocation of `s4 /tmp/file.mp3` will attempt to
process `file.mp3`. It will be treated as a UTF8 text log file.

### Limitations

- Only processes UTF-8 or ASCII encoded syslog files. ([Issue #16])
- Cannot process multi-file `.gz` files (only processes first stream found).
  ([Issue #8])
- Cannot process multi-file `.xz` files (only processes first stream found).
  ([Issue #11])
- Cannot process `.zip` archives ([Issue #39])
- <span id="f1"><sup>\[1\]</sup></span> ISO 8601
  - ISO 8601 forms recognized (using [ISO descriptive format])
    - `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss`
    - `YYYY-MM-DDThhmmss`
    - `YYYYMMDDThhmmss`

### Building locally

Building on Linux requires:

- `rust` _minimal_ or more
- `gcc` (which should install `cc`, `libc`, and `libc-headers`)

Building on Windows requires _Visual Studio_.
[`rustup-init.exe`] will help install the necessary tools.

From the git cloned project directory run `cargo build`.

[`rustup-init.exe`]: https://rustup.rs/

### Parsing `.journal` files

Requires `libsystemd` to be installed to use `libsystemd.so` at runtime.

### Requesting Support For DateTime Formats; your particular log file

If you have found a log file that _Super Speedy Syslog Searcher_ does not parse
then you may create a [new Issue type _Feature request (datetime format)_].

Here is [an example user-submitted Issue].

[new Issue type _Feature request (datetime format)_]: https://github.com/jtmoon79/super-speedy-syslog-searcher/issues/new/choose
[an example user-submitted Issue]: https://github.com/jtmoon79/super-speedy-syslog-searcher/issues/81

### "syslog" and other project definitions

#### syslog

In this project, the term "_syslog_" is used generously to refer to any
log message that has a datetime stamp on the first line of log text.

Technically, "_syslog_" is [defined among several RFCs]
proscribing fields, formats, lengths, and other technical constraints.
In this project, the term "_syslog_" is interchanged with "_log_".

The term "_sysline_" refers to a one log message which may comprise
multiple text lines.

See [docs section _Definitions of data_] for more project definitions.

[defined among several RFCs]: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Syslog&oldid=1219545533#Internet_standard_documents
[docs section _Definitions of data_]: https://docs.rs/super_speedy_syslog_searcher/latest/s4lib/data/index.html

#### log message

A "log message" is a single log entry for any type of logging scheme;
an entry in a utmpx file, an entry in a systemd journal, an entry in a
Windows Event Log, a formal RFC 5424 syslog message, or an ad-hoc log message.

---

## logging chaos: the problem `s4` solves

In practice, most log file formats are an ad-hoc format. And among formally
defined log formats, there are many variations. The result is merging varying
log messages by datetime is prohibitively tedious.
If an engineer is investigating a problem that is symptomatic among many log
files then the engineer must "hunt and peck" among those many log files.
Log files can not be merged for a single coherent view.

The following real-world example log files are available in project directory
`./logs`.

### open-source software examples

#### nginx webserver

For example, the open-source nginx web server
[logs access attempts in an ad-hoc format] in the file `access.log`

```text
192.168.0.115 - - [08/Oct/2022:22:26:35 +0000] "GET /DOES-NOT-EXIST HTTP/1.1" 404 0 "-" "curl/7.76.1" "-"
```

which is an entirely dissimilar log format to the neighboring nginx log file,
`error.log`

```text
2022/10/08 22:26:35 [error] 6068#6068: *3 open() "/usr/share/nginx/html/DOES-NOT-EXIST" failed (2: No such file or directory), client: 192.168.0.115, server: _, request: "GET /DOES-NOT-EXIST HTTP/1.0", host: "192.168.0.100"
```

nginx is following the bad example set by the apache web server.

#### Debian 11

Here are log snippets from a Debian 11 host.

file `/var/log/alternatives.log`

```text
update-alternatives 2022-10-10 23:59:47: run with --quiet --remove rcp /usr/bin/ssh
```

file `/var/log/dpkg.log`

```text
2022-10-10 15:15:02 upgrade gpgv:amd64 2.2.27-2 2.2.27-2+deb11u1
```

file `/var/log/kern.log`

```text

```

file `/var/log/unattended-upgrades/unattended-upgrades-shutdown.log`

```text
2022-10-10 23:07:16,775 WARNING - Unable to monitor PrepareForShutdown() signal, polling instead.
```

#### binary files

And then there are binary files, such as the `wtmp` file on Linux and other
Unix Operating Systems.
Using tool `utmpdump`, a `utmp` record structure is converted to text like:

```text
[7] [12103] [ts/0] [user] [pts/0] [172.1.2.1] [172.1.2.2] [2023-03-05T23:12:36,270185+00:00]
```

And from a _systemd_ `.journal` file, read using `journalctl`

```text
Mar 03 10:26:10 host systemd[1]: Started OpenBSD Secure Shell server.
░░ Subject: A start job for unit ssh.service has finished successfully
░░ Defined-By: systemd
░░ Support: http://www.ubuntu.com/support
░░
░░ A start job for unit ssh.service has finished successfully.
░░
░░ The job identifier is 120.
Mar 03 10:31:23 host sshd[4559]: Accepted login for user1 from 172.1.2.1 port 51730 ssh2
```

Try merging those two log messages by datetime using GNU `grep`, `sort`, `sed`,
or `awk`!

Additionally, if the `wtmp` file is from a different architecture
or Operating System, then the binary record structure is likely not parseable
by the resident `utmpdump` tool. What then!?

### commercial software examples

Commercial software and computer hardware vendors nearly always use
ad-hoc log message formatting that is even more unpredictable among each log
file on the same system.

#### Synology DiskStation

Here are log file snippets from a Synology DiskStation host.

(yes, it reads hour `14`, and `PM`…  🙄)

### Summary

This chaotic logging approach is typical of commercial and open-source software,
__*AND IT'S A MESS!*__
Attempting to merge log messages by their natural sort mechanism,
a datetime stamp, is difficult to impossible.

Hence the need for _Super Speedy Syslog Searcher_! 🦸
`s4` merges varying log files into a single coherent datetime-sorted log.
