# Super Speedy Syslog Searcher! (`s4`) <!-- omit in toc -->

Speedily search and merge log messages by datetime.

_Super Speedy Syslog Searcher_ (`s4`) is a command-line tool to search
and merge varying log messages from varying log files, sorted by datetime.
This includes log files that are compressed (`.gz`, `.xz`), or archived (`.tar`),
and binary format logs including utmpx user accounting records (`utmp`, `wtmp`),
systemd journal logs (`.journal`), and Microsoft Event Logs (`.evtx`).
It will parse a variety of formal and ad-hoc log message datetime formats.

Datetime filters may be passed to narrow the search to a datetime range.

The first goal of `s4` is speedy searching and printing.

### `--help`

```lang-text
Speedily search and merge log messages by datetime.
DateTime filters may be passed to narrow the search.
It aims to be very fast.

Usage: s4 [OPTIONS] <PATHS>...

Arguments:
  <PATHS>...  Path(s) of log files or directories.
              Directories will be recursed. Symlinks will be followed.
              Paths may also be passed via STDIN, one per line. The user must
              supply argument "-" to signify PATHS are available from STDIN.

Options:
  -a, --dt-after <DT_AFTER>
          DateTime Filter After: print syslog lines with a datetime that is at
          or after this datetime.
          For example, "20200102T120000" or "-5d".
  -b, --dt-before <DT_BEFORE>
          DateTime Filter Before: print syslog lines with a datetime that is at
          or before this datetime.
          For example, "2020-01-03T23:00:00.321-05:30" or "@+1d+11h"
  -t, --tz-offset <TZ_OFFSET>
          Default timezone offset for datetimes without a timezone.
          For example, log message "[20200102T120000] Starting service" has a
          datetime substring "20200102T120000".
          The datetime substring does not have a timezone offset
          so the TZ_OFFSET value would be used.
          Example values, "+12", "-0800", "+02:00", or "EDT".
          To pass a value with leading "-" use "=" notation, e.g. "-t=-0800".
          If not passed then the local system timezone offset is used.
          [default: -07:00]
  -z, --prepend-tz <PREPEND_TZ>
          Prepend a DateTime in the timezone PREPEND_TZ for every line.
          Used in PREPEND_DT_FORMAT.
  -u, --prepend-utc
          Prepend a DateTime in the UTC timezone offset for every line.
          This is the same as "--prepend-tz Z".
          Used in PREPEND_DT_FORMAT.
  -l, --prepend-local
          Prepend DateTime in the local system timezone offset for every line.
          This is the same as "--prepend-tz +XX" where +XX is the local system
          timezone offset.
          Used in PREPEND_DT_FORMAT.
  -d, --prepend-dt-format <PREPEND_DT_FORMAT>
          Prepend a DateTime using the strftime format string.
          If PREPEND_TZ is set then that value is used for any timezone offsets,
          i.e. strftime "%z" "%:z" "%Z" values, otherwise the timezone offset value
          is the local system timezone offset.
          [Default: %Y%m%dT%H%M%S%.3f%z]
  -n, --prepend-filename
          Prepend file basename to every line.
  -p, --prepend-filepath
          Prepend file full path to every line.
  -w, --prepend-file-align
          Align column widths of prepended data.
      --prepend-separator <PREPEND_SEPARATOR>
          Separator string for prepended data.
          [default: :]
      --separator <LOG_MESSAGE_SEPARATOR>
          An extra separator string between printed log messages.
          Per log message not per line of text.
          Accepts a basic set of backslash escape sequences,
          e.g. "\0" for the null character.
      --journal-output <JOURNAL_OUTPUT>
          The format for .journal file log messages.
          Matches journalctl --output options.
          [default: short]
          [possible values: short, short-precise, short-iso, short-iso-precise, short-full, short-monotonic, short-unix, verbose, export, cat]
  -c, --color <COLOR_CHOICE>
          Choose to print to terminal using colors.
          [default: auto]
          [possible values: always, auto, never]
      --blocksz <BLOCKSZ>
          Read blocks of this size in bytes.
          May pass value as any radix (hexadecimal, decimal, octal, binary).
          Using the default value is recommended.
          Most useful for developers.
          [default: 65535]
  -s, --summary
          Print a summary of files processed to stderr.
          Most useful for developers.
  -h, --help
          Print help
  -V, --version
          Print version

DateTime Filters may be strftime specifier patterns:
    "%Y%m%dT%H%M%S*"
    "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S*"
    "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S*"
    "%Y%m%d"
    "%Y-%m-%d"
    "%Y/%m/%d"
    "+%s"
Each * is an optional trailing 3-digit fractional sub-seconds and/or timezone.

Pattern "+%s" is Unix epoch timestamp in seconds with a preceding "+".
For example, value "+946684800" is be January 1, 2000 at 00:00, GMT.

DateTime Filters may be custom relative offset patterns:
    "+DwDdDhDmDs" or "-DwDdDhDmDs"
    "@+DwDdDhDmDs" or "@-DwDdDhDmDs"

Custom relative offset pattern "+DwDdDhDmDs" and "-DwDdDhDmDs" is the offset
from now (program start time) where "D" is a decimal number.
Each lowercase identifier is an offset duration:
"w" is weeks, "d" is days, "h" is hours, "m" is minutes, "s" is seconds.
For example, value "-1w22h" is one week and twenty-two hours in the past.
Value "+30s" is thirty seconds in the future.

Custom relative offset pattern "@+DwDdDhDmDs" and "@-DwDdDhDmDs" is relative
offset from the other datetime.
Arguments "-a 20220102 -b @+1d" are equivalent to "-a 20220102 -b 20220103".
Arguments "-a @-6h -b 20220101T120000" are equivalent to
"-a 20220101T060000 -b 20220101T120000".

Without a timezone offset (strftime specifier "%z" or "%Z"),
the Datetime Filter is presumed to be the local system timezone.

Timezones may be numeric timezone offsets, e.g. "+09:00", "+0900", or "+09",
or named timezone offsets, e.g. "JST".
Ambiguous named timezones will be rejected, e.g. "SST".

--prepend-tz and --dt-offset function independently:
--dt-offset is used to interpret processed log message datetime stamps that
do not have a timezone offset.
--prepend-tz affects what is pre-printed before each printed log message line.

--separator accepts backslash escape sequences:
    "\0","\a","\b","\e","\f","\n","\r","\\","\t","\v",

Resolved values of "--dt-after" and "--dt-before" can be reviewed in
the "--summary" output.

DateTime strftime specifiers are described at
https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/

DateTimes supported are only of the Gregorian calendar.

DateTimes supported language is English.

## About

_Super Speedy Syslog Searcher_ (`s4`) is meant to aid Engineers in reviewing
varying log files in a datetime-sorted manner.
The primary use-case is to aid investigating problems wherein the time of
problem occurrence is known but otherwise there is little source evidence.

Currently, log file formats vary widely. _Most_ logs are an ad-hoc format.
Even separate log files on the same system for the same service may have
different message formats! 😵
Sorting these logged messages by datetime may be prohibitively difficult.
The result is an engineer may have to "hunt and peck" among many log files,
looking for problem clues around some datetime; so tedious!

Enter _Super Speedy Syslog Searcher_ 🦸 ‼

`s4` will print log messages from multiple log files in datetime-sorted order.
A "window" of datetimes may be passed, to constrain the period of printed
messages. This will assist an engineer that, for example, needs to view all
syslog messages that occurred two days ago among log files taken from multiple
systems.

The ulterior motive for _Super Speedy Syslog Searcher_ was the [primary
developer](https://github.com/jtmoon79) wanted an excuse to learn rust 🦀,
and wanted to create an open-source tool for a recurring need of some
Software Test Engineers 😄

A longer rambling pontification about this project is in
[`Extended-Thoughts.md`].

<br/>

## More

### Building locally

Building on Linux requires:

- `rust` _minimal_ or more
- `gcc` (which should install `cc`, `libc`, and `libc-headers`)

From the git cloned project directory run `cargo build`.

### Parsing `.journal` files

Requires `libsystemd` to be installed to then use `libsystemd.so`.

### Requesting Support For DateTime Formats; your particular log file

If you have found a log file that _Super Speedy Syslog Searcher_ does not parse
then you may create a [new Issue type _Feature request (datetime format)_].

Here is [an example user-submitted Issue].

[new Issue type _Feature request (datetime format)_]: https://github.com/jtmoon79/super-speedy-syslog-searcher/issues/new/choose
[an example user-submitted Issue]: https://github.com/jtmoon79/super-speedy-syslog-searcher/issues/81

### "syslog" and other project definitions

#### syslog

In this project, the term "_syslog_" is used generously to refer to any
log message that has a datetime stamp on the first line of log text.

Technically, "_syslog_" is [defined among several RFCs]
proscribing fields, formats, lengths, and other technical constraints.
In this project, the term "_syslog_" is interchanged with "_log_".

The term "_sysline_" refers to a one log message which may comprise
multiple text lines.

See [docs section _Definitions of data_] for more project definitions.

[defined among several RFCs]: ttps://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Syslog&oldid=1110915683#Internet_standard_documents
[docs section _Definitions of data_]: https://docs.rs/super_speedy_syslog_searcher/latest/s4lib/data/index.html

#### log message

A "log message" is a single log entry for any type of logging scheme;
an entry in a utmpx file, an entry in a systemd journal, an entry in a
Windows Event Log, a formal syslog message, or an ad-hoc log message.

### logging chaos; the problem `s4` solves

In practice, most log file formats are an ad-hoc format that
may not follow any formal definition. Sorting varying log messages by datetime
is prohibitively tedious.

The following real-world example log files are available in project directory
`./logs`.

For example, the open-source nginx web server
[logs access attempts in an ad-hoc format] in the file `access.log`

```text
192.168.0.115 - - [08/Oct/2022:22:26:35 +0000] "GET /DOES-NOT-EXIST HTTP/1.1" 404 0 "-" "curl/7.76.1" "-"
```

which is an entirely dissimilar log format to the neighboring nginx log file,
`error.log`

```text
2022/10/08 22:26:35 [error] 6068#6068: *3 open() "/usr/share/nginx/html/DOES-NOT-EXIST" failed (2: No such file or directory), client: 192.168.0.115, server: _, request: "GET /DOES-NOT-EXIST HTTP/1.0", host: "192.168.0.100"
```

nginx is following the bad example set by the apache web server.

<br/>

Commercial software and computer hardware vendors nearly always use
ad-hoc log message formatting that is even more unpredictable among each log
file on the same system.
